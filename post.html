                    <h2 class = "section-heading">Background of the Case:</h2>

                    <p> Christopher Eckhardt, John Tinker, and Mary Beth Tinker wore black armbands to protest the Vietnam War in 1965. Their school banned the protest, and they were expelled from school days later. Their parents took the school to federal court, claiming their children's right to free speech had been denied.</p>

                    

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Supreme Court’s Decision: </h2>

                    <p>The school suspensions were found unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court in February 1969, in a 7–2 ruling.  The majority opinion, written by Justice Abe Fortas, first established that the student’s actions were "alike to pure speech." Although  their protest did not include any speaking, he argued that it deserved "First Amendment protection rights."</p>

                    <blockquote>"It can hardly be argued that either students or teachers shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate." Justice Abe Fortas, in Tinker v. Des Moines, 1969.</blockquote>

                    

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Why It Matters: </h2>

                    <p>It matters because the decision that was made by the supreme court helped form an example, Presendent, that students don’t shed the right of free speech once they enter school grounds.</p>

                    <h2 class = "section-heading">Analyzing the Case: Why did the students' lawyers argue that wearing the armbands was protected by the First Amendment?</h2>
                    <p>At the school doors, students do not lose their constitutional rights to freedom of speech. Since wearing a black armband was not harmful, the court ruled that students' freedom to wear them was protected under the First Amendment.</p>

                    <h2 class = "section-heading">How did Justice Fortas's concept of "pure speech" extend First Amendment free speech rights?</h2>
                    <p>Justice Fortas's concept of "pure speech" extends that although  their protest did not include any speaking, he argued that it deserved "First Amendment protection rights."</p>
